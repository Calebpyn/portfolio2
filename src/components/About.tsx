                Hey, I am Caleb Pay√°n. <br/>
                I am a self-motivated individual with a strong sense of organization and focus. When confronted with a challenge, I approach it with a multidimensional perspective, seeking to understand it fully before devising a solution. In addition, I am committed to continual learning and personal development and strive to apply the lessons learned from each challenge to future endeavors. During my leisure time, I indulge in photography, art, and music, nurturing my creativity and enriching my perspectives.
